If you or your organization have a requirement to prevent your data from being synced to our Cloud, you will want to use the app without an account and manually back up your data locally. With the release of 6.x, we no longer offer the option of disabling sync while logged in as it is effectively the equivalent of using the app without an account.
If you need your data to be removed from our servers, please refer to the article below.

Please review the relevant documentation on Sync [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/sync_gettingstarted).
